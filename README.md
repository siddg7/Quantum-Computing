# Quantum-Computing

Implementation of Quantum ALgorithms on IBM Qiskit.

This repository has the following files 
  1. Quantum Factorisation. Here I discuss classical and quantum algorithms to factor numbers. I also discuss some of the experimental implementations of Shor's algorithm.
  2. Grover's Algorithm for 2 qubits. 
  3. Quantum Fourier Transform
  4. Quantum Teleportation.
